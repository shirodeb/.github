## ShiroDEB
ShiroDEB is **currently** a script set for build and uploading FOSS to UOS/Deepin App Store.

ShiroDEB consists of:
  - ShiroDEB, a script for creating, building, testing and saving Debs in UOS specifications.
  - Utils, some scripts for improve the workflow of uploading a FOSS to UOS/Deepin App Store.
  - Build Scripts, The build script I wrote for some simple repacking FOSS like appimage/deb.
  - MUSE, Make Uploading Software Easy, an userscript for reduce some bored click in Dev center of UOS.

ShiroDEB is aimed to simplify *my* workflow, and in *my* favorite way.

Build deb could clearly be done via Debian's makefile rules. But I don't like it.

ShiroDEB is mostly like a PKGBUILD way.
