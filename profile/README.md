## ShiroDEB
ShiroDEB is **currently** a script set for build and uploading FOSS to UOS/Deepin App Store.

ShiroDEB consists of:
  - [ShiroDEB](https://github.com/shirodeb/shirodeb), a script for creating, building, testing and saving Debs in UOS specifications.
  - Utils, some scripts for improve the workflow of uploading a FOSS to UOS/Deepin App Store.
  - [Recipes](https://github.com/shirodeb/recipes), The build script I wrote for shirodeb.
  - [Ingredients](https://github.com/shirodeb/ingredients), The ingredients menu for shirodeb.
  - [MUSE](https://github.com/shirodeb/MUSE), Make Uploading Software Easy, an userscript for reduce some bored click in Dev center of UOS.

ShiroDEB is aimed to simplify *my* workflow, and in *my* favorite way.

Build deb could clearly be done via Debian's makefile rules. But *I don't like it*, so I wrote this one.

ShiroDEB is mostly like a PKGBUILD way.
